This folder contains additional wordlists. They should contain one word per
line, should be sorted (in UTF-8 (!)) and their name should end in .txt, other
files will be ignored by the build script. The lists are expected to be quite
trustworthy and to have mostly different sources than Bumbeishvilis words.

The licenses of the wordlists must be compatible with the license of the
generated dictionary.
