This folder contains word lists for the dictionary. They should contain one word
per line, should be sorted (in UTF-8 (!)) and their name should end in '.txt'.
The lists are expected to be quite trustworthy and to have mostly different
sources. A file with extension '.low' may contain words which are considered
lesser trustworthy. If they appear in an other file or give good results in the
automatic affix compression, they will be used in, or else removed from the
resulting dictionary. Make sure this lists are sorted too and contain no words
from the corresponding main word list, since such words would be taken to be
correct straight away.

The licenses of the word lists must be compatible with the license of the
generated dictionary.
