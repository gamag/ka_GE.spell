Contains:

- Hunspell dictionary (for OpenOffice.org, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, ...)
- Script to generate the dictionary from wordlists

## Dictionary installation ##

TODO: How to install on other systems
TODO: Automatically build OpenOffice/Firefox/... package.

### Mac OS X (10.6 and later) ###

- Download or clone this repo.
- In `Finder`, select `Go To Folder` from `Go` menu, type in `~/Library`, click
  `Go` (for system wide installation, use `/Library` instead).
- In the `Library` directory, locate the folder `Spelling` or create it, if it is not there.
- Copy `ka_GE.aff` and `ka_GE.dic` from the repository (in `dictionaries/`) to the `Spelling` folder.

### Linux ###

copy `dictionaries/ka_GE.dic` and `dictionaries/ka_GE.aff` to `/usr/share/hunspell/`


## Data sources ##

Word lists by the following People / from the following sources are used to generate the dictionary:

- Dato Bumbeishvili (https://github.com/bumbeishvili/GeoWordsDatabase)
- Kevin Scannell (http://crubadan.org/languages/ka, CC-BY 4.0) 

Thanks a lot for your awesome work! 


## Update/build dictionary ##

You need a bash compatible shell, gnu tools and  hunspell (and
hunspell-tools on some systems) installed.

To build the dictionary run `make all`

### Updating Bumbeishvilis word list ###

NOTE: the word list is included in `words/`, you don't need this steps to work
on the dictionary.

You need a running mysql server and git.

Clone this repository

Log into mysql and add a user and a database for the word list:

```bash
$ mysql -uroot -p
mysql > CREATE DATABASE geoword;
mysql > CREATE USER 'geowords'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
mysql > CREATE USER 'geowords'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
mysql > GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON geowords.\* TO 'geowords'@'localhost'; 
mysql > FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Create a file called dbaccess in the ka\_GE.spell root.
containing:

```bash
DBNAME=geowords
DBUSER=geowords
DBPASS=password
```

call `make db`


## Remarks ##

The automatically created dictionary is not very accurate, some words may be wrong,
many missing. Also, the affix file is optimized for automatic handling using
`munch` from hunspell and describes the Georgian language in a very suboptimal
way. More work needs to be done to clean that, which implies a move from
automatic to manual affix compression (or implement something to do it
semiautomatic, so the wordlist can be updated from database without loosing
manual corrections).

TODO: translate to Georgian.
